# Vampire Survivor

A simple Python game coded up by following [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OMghdHP-zs&ab_channel=ClearCode), and my first experience making a game!

## Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install requirements (there's only one!)
    ```
    pip install requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run `main.py` to play!
    ```
    python3 main.py
    ```
